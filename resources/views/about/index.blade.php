                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is me ðŸ‘† and my name is Ilya. Already for many years, I am working as a Software Engineer. And the first thing you have to know about me I am mad about coding. From the very begging of my carrier I was concentrating on delivering optimized and highly maintainable features.
                        <p>My geeky nature never let me stop improving my skills and constantly learning new stuff. For the past years, I tried myself as a developer in different domains such as remote education, music distribution, grocery delivery, and fintech. Filled my stack with different programming languages: PHP, Golang, NodeJS, JavaScript; frameworks: Laravel, React, Vue; Tools: Kafka, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, Redis, Doker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, etc.; and databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL</p>
                        <p>Currently, all of my experience allows me to build high-end web applications with all modern technologies and approaches. </p>
